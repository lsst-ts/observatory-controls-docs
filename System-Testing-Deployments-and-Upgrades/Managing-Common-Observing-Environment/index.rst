.. note::

    Managing the common observing environment requires authorization. 
    Please check with Tiago Ribeiro for access.

The common observing evironment (obs-env) is a set of packages deployed on the nfs mount for quick access.
These packages are managed by a package called manage_obs_env which can only be executed by the obsenv user.
